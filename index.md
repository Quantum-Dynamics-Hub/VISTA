# Virtual International Seminar on Theoretical Advancements (VISTA)

The bi-weekly seminar series “Virtual International Seminar on Theory Advancement” (VISTA) will
feature presentations by researchers at various levels (from undergraduates to faculty) and will be held via Zoom.
The seminars will span a range of topics, but generally, they will focus on new developments in quantum and nonadiabatic dynamics, trajectory-based approaches, semiclassical and quantum-classical methodologies, quantum control, new software and methodologies, and the applications to various solar energy and nanoscale materials problems. Some experimental works may also be of interest, especially those that require and can benefit from theoretical investigations. The presentations can feature already published works, or the ongoing research efforts (incomplete work) if the presenter is comfortable with such an early sharing of their ideas. The latter will promote active discussions and facilitate community forging. The presenter will benefit from early and extensive feedback on their current work, which shall improve the overall quality of their published works.
