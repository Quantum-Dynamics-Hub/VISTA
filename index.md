# Virtual International Seminar on Theoretical Advancements (VISTA)

## About VISTA
The bi-weekly seminar series "Virtual International Seminar on Theory Advancement" (VISTA) is a 
"presentation journal", a platform to facilitate interactions and scientific discussions of the International
 community at covid time and beyond. The seminar features presentations by researchers at various levels (from undergraduate
 students to faculty and scientists) on theory and computations for nonequilibrium dynamics of excited states and quantum dynamics,
 broadly defined. Of special interest to this seminar are new developments in quantum and nonadiabatic dynamics,
 trajectory-based and surface hopping approaches, semiclassical and quantum-classical methodologies, new software and tools
 for nonadiabatic and quantum dynamics, as well as the applications of these cutting-edge techniques to a variety of 
 complex systems and materials, such as solar energy harvesting and photoresponsive materials. The experimental works that require 
 the attention of and can benefit from theoretical investigations are also of interest. 

### **Keywords and topics:**
- nonadiabatic dynamics
- excited states
- quantum dynamics
- quantum-classical methods
- charge transfer
- excitation energy transfer
- trajectory surface hopping
- TD-DFT
- algorithms, methods, and software for excited state, nonadiabatic, and quantum dynamics
